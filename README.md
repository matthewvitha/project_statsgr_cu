#PLEASE REVIEW THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK THAT ENDS WITH FINALDRAFT_EDITED. 

#please ALSO note, the code is ran using 1k lines of text data for speed. You can alter this using the df_small dataframe that is defined after the preprocess function. 

#I also had some trouble uploading the HTML file so that it is easily viewed when accessed from the github repo. 

#When running the code, the Pandas profiling is used to view EDA for the demographic data. You can toggle it in the jupyter notebook when running so that you can see histograms for frequencies of gender, marital status, etc. 

#When running the code, the plots for TFIDF, KMeans, and LDA are interactive. For the first two, you can hover over the points to see the description of the happy moment. For the LDA plot, you can hover over the topic bubbles to identify which words frequently appear in the topic.
